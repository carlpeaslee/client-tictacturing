        Hi my name is Carl Peaslee. I do a lot of things. Some of them pretty good –– except for copywriting, I guess technically I do that <b>well.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Writer. Developer. Artist. Tinkerer. Lover of one word sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's see... What else? I live in Minneapolis with my partner, Julia, our bonkers cat, Grilled Cheese, and a yet to be named lemon tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Checkout my projects. Read my writing. Whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always looking for new things to work on –– both serious captalism stuff and JFF projects –– so don't hesitate to reach out by email or social media.
      </p>
    </div>
